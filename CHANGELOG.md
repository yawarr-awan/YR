# Changelog

## 1.4.0

- **Today's Brief**: a new card at the top of the Today tab, powered by Google Calendar + Gemini. Connect your Google Calendar (OAuth, `calendar.readonly` only — Gmail was deliberately left out to avoid Google's restricted-scope verification/security-assessment requirements) and a short AI summary of the day's schedule generates automatically every morning at 7am London time (self-adjusts across BST/GMT), plus a manual "Refresh"/"Generate now" button.
- New Worker endpoints: `GET /api/google/connect` and `GET /api/google/callback` (OAuth flow), `GET /api/brief` (read today's cached brief), `POST /api/brief/refresh` (regenerate on demand). A Cloudflare Cron Trigger fires hourly; the handler itself only acts during the target London hour and dedupes against D1, so it stays a once-a-day generation.
- New D1 tables: `google_tokens` (refresh/access tokens, one row per user), `daily_brief` (cached summary per user per day, with a distinct status for not-connected / pending / ok / calendar error / Gemini error / needs-reconnect, so the UI can say something precise instead of a generic failure).
- A failed or unreachable brief never breaks the rest of the Today tab — it's an isolated card with its own error states.
- New required Worker secrets: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` (set in the dashboard, same as the Access secrets).
- Added `test/worker.test.js` (loads the real `worker.js` via a `data:` URL import against a fake D1 + mocked `fetch`) and `test/brief.test.js` (jsdom coverage of the new card's states).

## 1.3.1

- **Fix:** `sw.js` broke every page load (`ERR_FAILED`) once installed as an app. Its fetch handler called `fetch()` on every intercepted GET, including the page navigation itself — but the Fetch spec forbids calling `fetch()` with a `Request` whose `mode` is `"navigate"`; it throws, which rejected the promise handed to `respondWith()`. Now navigations are never intercepted at all, same as `/api/*`. This likely also explains why the desktop install prompt never appeared: Chrome's installability check requires a working service worker, and this one was throwing on the very first navigation it saw.
- Added a dedicated unit-test suite for `sw.js` itself (`test/sw.test.js`) that pins this down: asserts `fetch()` is never called with a navigate-mode request, alongside the existing `/api/*` and non-GET exclusions.

## 1.3.0

- Real "Install as an app" support: a service worker (`sw.js`) caches the static app shell for offline loads, and never touches `/api/*` — sync and Cloudflare Access always hit the network untouched.
- New "📲 Install as an app" card in the Progress tab: a working Install button on Chrome/Edge/Android (captures `beforeinstallprompt`), Share → Add to Home Screen guidance on iOS Safari (which has no such prompt), and generic bookmark guidance elsewhere. Hides itself entirely once already running standalone.
- Test coverage for all of the above in the jsdom suite.

## 1.2.0

- Client-side sync layer: every day's record and your profile now carry an `updated_at` stamp, set on every edit.
- One-time migration stamps existing history from before this change, so it participates in sync correctly.
- Opt-in "Enable cloud sync" toggle in the Progress tab (off by default, never auto-enabled) that syncs to the `yr-wellness` Worker backend via `/api/sync`, merging with true last-write-wins.
- A failed or unreachable sync never touches local data — your on-device history stays authoritative either way.
- Added a jsdom-based test suite (`npm test`) covering storage corruption/recovery, the schema migration, and multi-device sync conflicts.
